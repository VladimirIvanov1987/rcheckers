# 🏁 Russian Checkers (Shashki) in R Shiny

A fully functional implementation of the classic **Russian Checkers**
board game, built entirely using **R** and the **Shiny** framework.

This project demonstrates the capabilities of R beyond data analysis,
implementing complex game logic, state management, and a reactive user
interface.

## ✨ Features

-   **Game Rules**: Full implementation of Russian Checkers rules:
    -   Mandatory captures (including backward captures).
    -   "Flying Kings" (Dames).
    -   Chain captures (multijump).
-   **Game Modes**:
    -   **PvP**: Player vs Player (Hotseat).
    -   **PvE**: Player vs AI (Basic heuristic engine).
-   **Interface**:
    -   Clean, dark-themed UI using `bslib`.
    -   Bilingual support: **English** and **Russian** (auto-switching).
    -   Move history logging.

## 🚀 How to Run

You can run this application directly from RStudio.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have R installed. You will need the `devtools` package to
handle dependencies easily. r install.packages("devtools") \###
Launching the App Clone this repository or download the source code,
then run: r 📌 1. Install required packages (shiny, bslib, shinyjs,
etc.)devtools::install_deps()

📌 2. Load the package devtools::load_all()

📌 3. Start the game run_app()

## 🛠 Tech Stack

-   **R Language**: Core logic.
-   **Shiny**: Web application framework.
-   **bslib**: Modern Bootstrap 5 theming.
-   **shinyjs**: JavaScript integration for UI interactions.

## 🗺 Roadmap & Future Improvements

This project is currently in the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** stage.
We are actively working on the following updates:

-   **UI Performance**: Switching from full `renderUI` re-rendering to
    **JavaScript-based updates** to eliminate screen flickering and
    improve responsiveness.
-   **AI Engine**: Upgrading the AI from a simple heuristic greedy
    algorithm to a **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning** for
    deeper strategic play.
-   **Visuals**: Replacing CSS-based checkers with high-quality **SVG
    assets** and adding smooth move animations.
-   **Refactoring**: Separation of core logic from the UI layer for
    better testability.
